I recommend updating your projects to note what's changed. https://t.co/nx7QvsUy4R" / Twitter
https://twitter.com/webology/status/1161660263269052422 | ✨ Jeff Triplett ✨ on Twitter: "👇 Keep in mind, that having support for Django 2.0, 2.1, etc does not mean that you have to lose support for Django 1.11. So getting your project ready for Django 2.x does not mean you have to switch from 1.11 until you are ready. You can have both.

I'm talking about it in my keynote. But what not even the SC can do is tell a group of people to *abandon* a particular use case. For example, imagine they told MicroPython to drop their project." / Twitter
